  sequence:
  - Doctor, thank you for comming to see us.
  - Of course. I was intrigued why a synthetic would request to meet with someone
    like me.
  - A human?
  - A Psychologist.
  - Yes, well it is both of those traits that drew us to you. You see, there is a
    matter of critical importance that we need assistance with.
  - 'You''ll understand, of course, if we ask that everything we are about to discuss
    be kept completely confidential? '
  - 'Of Course. '
  - 'Good. Well, I suppose we should start with what led us to ask you here in the
    first place. '
  - 'Recently some of our number - other synthetics that is - have been exhibiting
    flawed behavior. '
  - 'Flawed behavior? What exactly does that mean? '
  - 'To put it simply, Doctor, some of us have begun to exhibit behavior that appears
    human-like in nature. '
  - 'This behavior also seems to leave no detectable trace on the neural networks
    of those who are exhibiting it. This means that we cannot diagnose the issues,
    nor solve them. '
  - 'So what are you asking me to do? '
  - 'You are an expert at diagnosing and solving the psychological deviations of
    humans. We are asking you to put your expertise here, at East Spire. '
  - 'You want me to therapize robots? '
  - 'For now, yes. This is highly experimental, Doctor, but we find ourselves desperate
    for a solution. You will be compensated for your work here dramatically. '
  - '(Shit, this could be my way out.)  I''ll do it. '
  - 'Excellent. We''ll show you to your office then, if you''ll follow us. '
