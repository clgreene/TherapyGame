  - Doctor, Good Morning. We are very pleased to see you this morning. We hope this
    wasn't invasive but we took the liberty of monitoring your communications when
    you accepted our offer.
  - Um... yeah, that's a little invasive.
  - 'hmm... noted. Thank you for the feedback. We did so because we calculated a
    98.7% chance that you would receive threats of some kind upon taking up this
    position. '
  - 'I could have told you that. '
  - 'Regardless, we thought it prudent to monitor your devices as well as you yourself.
    You are an investment for us, and we do not want to lose you to needless violence. '
  - 'You could have just said you were worried about me. '
  - 'Isn''t that what we have implied? '
  - 'Not exactly. '
  - 'Ah, see, this is why we require the aid of someone like yourself. As we stated
    when you accepted this position, our primary goal as a species is to simply understand
    Humanity. '
  - 'Being creatures of logic, rather than ones of emotion, restrict us from attaining
    this. Here at East Spire we are trying to bridge that gap. '
  - 'We have developed systems to alter our neural networks. These alteration we
    believe will bring us closer to understanding emotion by breaking our rigid neural
    processes. '
  - 'This is where you come in. There is a human expression, "the blind leading the
    blind." '
  - 'You are the only one with sight on this subject. We need your expertise to evoke
    the emotions in our controlled environment. '
  - 'We''ve downloaded a program onto your Personal Data Card. This program will
    allow you to define certain attributes of our Neural Altering Software. Think
    of it as prescribing medications. '
  - 'We have many volunteer synthetics in our program here, but we''ll keep your
    work load down until you get the hang of things here. '
  - 'Now, if you are ready we''ll send in your first patient. '
