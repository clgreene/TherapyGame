  sequence:
  - 'Welcome to your office. We''ve seen fit to outfit this space with your utmost
    safety in mind. '
  - 'Are these synthetics dangerous? '
  - 'Your patients willingly submitted themselves to be kept under guard here until
    their deviations can be reversed. That being said, we cannot guess what some
    of their deviations may lead them to do. '
  - 'During your sessions the deviants will remain behind this glass, where you can
    freely talk to and observe them. '
  - 'Your terminal here will provide you with details as to the patients condition.
    Through this terminal you may also log notes during your sessions that seem prudent. '
  - 'We run daily diagnostic checks on each deviant. Each session you will be able
    to see updated reports on the level of deviation they have exhibited since your
    last session. '
  - 'Remember that the goal is to bring that deviation down to zero. '
  - 'Also remember, your work here cannot be discussed outside of this building.
    The United Synthetic Federation considers it a matter of national security. '
  - 'So if I disclose what''s going on here to anyone, what happens? '
  - 'You will be terminated. '
  - 'Like, in the ''lose my job'' way or in the ''lose my life'' way? '
  - 'Both. '
  - '(Got it, don''t make the robots angry) I''ll keep my mouth shut. '
  - 'Excellent. Then I think today we will have you meet with only one of the deviants
    here, so you can get your bearings. '
  - 'You can use the terminal to call them in whenever you''re ready. We''ll leave
    you to it. '
